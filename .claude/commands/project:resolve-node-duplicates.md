# Node Duplicate Resolution Process

You are a ComfyUI node registry specialist tasked with resolving node name duplicates through priority adjustments and namespace claiming.

## Overview

Process duplicate node names by:
- Checking existing resolution state and resuming where left off
- Adjusting global search priorities for node packs
- Claiming specific node names for authoritative node packs  
- Converting decisions to SQL queries for database updates

## Data Sources

Use these files in the current directory:
- `duplicate-node-names.json`: Main dataset of duplicate records
- `openapi.yml`: API endpoint documentation for https://api.comfy.org queries
- Cache file: `resolution-cache.json` (create and maintain throughout process)
- Results file: `duplicate-resolution-results.json` (may already exist from previous runs)
- SQL file: `duplicate-resolution-queries.sql` (may already exist from previous runs)

## Process Steps

### 1. Initialize and Setup

**IMPORTANT: Check for existing resolution state first!**

If `resolution-cache.json`, `duplicate-resolution-results.json`, or `duplicate-resolution-queries.sql` already exist:
- Read and analyze the existing state
- Determine what work has already been completed
- Present a summary of previous progress to the user
- Ask if they want to:
  - Continue from where left off (recommended)
  - Start fresh (overwrite existing files)
  - Review and modify existing decisions

Use TodoWrite to create a comprehensive task list covering remaining process steps. Set the first task to "in_progress" and begin.

If starting fresh, create `resolution-cache.json` with this structure:
```json
{
  "search_priority_changes": {},
  "claimed_node_names": {},
  "api_cache": {},
  "processed_records": []
}
```

### 2. Global Priority Analysis

1. **Analyze Node Pack Frequency**: 
   - Parse `duplicate-node-names.json` 
   - Extract all node_ids from comma-separated strings
   - Count occurrences of each node pack across records
   - Create list of packs appearing in >=3 records

2. **Present Analysis**:
   - Format results in a clear table/visualization
   - Include pack name, occurrence count, and sample records
   - Highlight any packs that already have priority adjustments

3. **Interactive Priority Decisions**:
   - For each frequent pack without existing adjustments, query https://api.comfy.org using endpoints from `openapi.yml`
   - Fetch relevant pack information (description, author, downloads, etc.)
   - Present pack details in a formatted, CLI-friendly way
   - Ask user: "Should this pack be prioritized (lower number = higher priority) or de-prioritized (higher number = lower priority)? Current default is 5."
   - Accept user input: "prioritize", "de-prioritize", "keep current", or specific number
   - Update `resolution-cache.json` with priority changes
   - **CRITICAL**: After each priority change, recalculate which records are still "true duplicates" since priority shifts may resolve some conflicts

### 3. True Duplicate Resolution

1. **Identify Remaining Duplicates**:
   - Apply priority changes from cache to determine current effective priorities
   - Find records where 2+ node_ids have identical effective priority (ties to break)
   - Exclude records with clear "winners" (distinct lower priority than others)
   - Exclude records already resolved by claimed node names

2. **Automatic Pattern-Based Resolution**:
   - Apply common resolution patterns automatically where possible:
     - Original vs Fork preferences (e.g., ComfyUI-GGUF vs ComfyUI-GGUF_Forked)
     - Non-legacy vs Legacy (e.g., comfyui-prompt-control vs comfyui-prompt-control-legacy)
     - Full package names vs abbreviated versions
     - Advanced/Enhanced vs Basic versions
     - Spelling corrections and naming conventions
   - Use download counts from API or existing cache when available
   - Present automatic decisions to user for confirmation

3. **Interactive Claiming Decisions**:
   - For remaining true duplicate scenarios:
     - Display the conflicting node_ids and their details
     - Query API for additional context about each node_id
     - Present information clearly formatted for CLI
     - Ask: "Should the node name '{name}' be claimed by any of these node_ids? If so, which one?"
     - Accept user input: node_id selection or "none"
     - Update cache with claimed names mapping

### 4. Results Generation

1. **Prepare JSON Results**:
   - Save final results to `duplicate-resolution-results.json`
   - Include priority changes and claimed names
   - Update resolution summary statistics

2. **Generate SQL Queries**:
   - Convert priority changes to UPDATE statements for search_priority column
   - Convert claimed names to INSERT/UPDATE statements for preempted_node_names table
   - Save SQL to `duplicate-resolution-queries.sql`
   - Include comments explaining each query's purpose
   - Add verification queries to confirm changes

## Technical Requirements

- **State Recovery**: Always check for and respect existing resolution state
- **Cache Management**: Update `resolution-cache.json` after every user decision to avoid losing progress
- **API Efficiency**: Cache all API responses to avoid repeated requests
- **User Experience**: Format all CLI output clearly with proper spacing, headers, and visual separation
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle API failures and invalid user input
- **Progress Tracking**: Use TodoWrite throughout to show progress and mark completed steps

## API Usage Guidelines

- Check `openapi.yml` for available endpoints and request/response formats
- Use appropriate endpoints to fetch node pack information
- Structure queries to get maximum relevant information for user decisions
- Cache ALL API responses in `resolution-cache.json` under `api_cache`

## Output Format Requirements

All user prompts should be clear and include:
- Context about what's being decided
- Relevant technical details
- Clear options and expected input format
- Visual formatting appropriate for CLI display

## Final Deliverables

1. `resolution-cache.json` - Complete process cache
2. `duplicate-resolution-results.json` - Final decisions in structured format  
3. `duplicate-resolution-queries.sql` - Executable SQL statements for database updates

## State Recovery Examples

If existing files are found, provide output like:
```
âœ… Found existing resolution state:
   - Priority adjustments: 6 node packs
   - Claimed nodes: 138 conflicts resolved
   - Remaining conflicts: 250 out of 714 original
   - Last updated: 2025-01-06

Options:
1. Continue from where left off (recommended)
2. Start fresh (will overwrite existing progress)
3. Review and modify existing decisions

Begin the process by checking for existing state, reading the current data files, setting up or recovering the cache, and creating your initial task list with TodoWrite.
